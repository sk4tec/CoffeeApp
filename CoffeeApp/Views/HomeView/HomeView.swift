import SwiftUI
// Notes on this take home project. I wanted to be careful not to exceed the 8 hours recommended time limit. These are outstanding tasks:
// 1 - I didn't get to persist the data - I saved this till last and I ran out of time. I would imagine
//     that SwiftData would be the way to go, I would decorate my CoffeeModel and I would try and load that if I didn't have network Access
// 2 - I couldn't get the "like" to work at the master level, NavigationView shares it's data as an Environment Object and I should be able to access that in the Detail View.
//     But, this didn't work and crashed - I commented it out and moved on.
// 3 - I didn't include any Combine because there really wasn't a need to overcomplicate the code. But send(input: Input) funcs could send to PassThroughSubjects.
// 4 - Strings should be localised
